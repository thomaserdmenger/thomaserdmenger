### Hi there, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹

<p>I've decided to start fresh and follow my long held desire to become a fullstack web developer.</p>
<p>Skills & Technologies: JavaScript ES6+ | Tailwind CSS | CSS | HTML | Git | GitHub | Command Line | I'm currently learning ReactJS and Node.js.</p>
<p>Self-motivated autodidactic learning has accompanied me my whole life. It gives me great pleasure. In January 2023 I started learning Frontend Web Development. Since December 2023, I have been attending a Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp at

  >SuperCode</a>, which I will finish at the end of June 2024.</p>
<p>I enjoy solution-oriented and independent work.</p>
<p>I have extensive leadership and management experience from my previous position as managing director of a real estate company and analytical skills from my work as a social science researcher for many years. I also have a degree in business administration, sociology and journalism.</p>
